## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

This dataset is incredibly multifaceted, allowing each of us to find different points of interest within the same dataset. Collectively, our interest in this dataset encapsulates the connection between adolescence and alcohol within the high school environment. One aspect that our group specifically wants to explore is whether there is a connection between parental education status and alcohol consumption. Another question that our group wants to explore is whether participation in extracurricular activities affects a students likelihood to consume alcohol. Our last aspect that we are studying looks at student percentiles and alchohol consumption. We assume that there's a negative correlation, as students with higher academic percentiles tend to study more during times that other students are partying. With the information from this dataset, we can confirm whether this is true. Creating a user-facing dashboard for this dataset would be a smart decision. This is because the data is so multifaceted and relatable to the average person. Pressure to consume alcohol within high school is a universal universal experience that many can relate to.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

This dataset, called Student Alcohol Consumption and created by UCI Machine Learning, consists of information regarding portuguese high school students. This information was collected from 2 public high schools, from 788 students in a math course and/or portuguese language course. Much of this information regards the student's academics, such as study time and grade numerics, and recreational behavior, such as extracurricular activities and weekend alcohol consumption. This dataset also encapsulates student demographics and students' family history. This data was gathered via survey, along with a few numerical attributes given from the school's reports (ex: term grades and student absences). The collection of this data was originally done by a portuguese professor who wanted to see the correlation between alcohol drinking and grades during 2005-2006. This dataset is now used on the UCI Machine Learning Archive. Its main purpose is to help students explore predictions using machine learning (ex: predicting students' final grades).
