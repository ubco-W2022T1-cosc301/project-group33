## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

This dataset is incredibly multifaceted, allowing each of us to find different points of interest within the same dataset. We were collectively interested due to its insight on adolescent experience within the highschool environment. This dataset contains general information, like basic demographics, along with very interesting information, such as academic measures, alcohol consumption, and parental information. These columns brought a lot of excitement and curiousity to our group. One member is very interested in looking at how the education of parents influences children's academics. Another member will focus on interesting column intersections, such as alcohol consumption, social and familial relationships, and academics. Our final member wants to specifically look at alcohol consumption's influence on grades. All of our research questions at least partially highlight what influences academics in high school. Creating a user-facing dashboard for this dataset would be a smart decision. This is because the data contains so much information, that anyone could find a perspective that they're interested in exploring. High school is a universal experience, adding relatability to this dataset.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

This dataset, called Student Alcohol Consumption was created by UCI Machine Learning. It consists of information regarding portuguese high school students. This information was collected from 2 public high schools, from 788 students in a math course and/or portuguese language course. Much of this information regards the student's academics, such as study time and grade numerics, and recreational behavior, such as extracurricular activities and weekend alcohol consumption. This dataset also encapsulates student demographics and students' family history. This data was gathered via survey, along with a few numerical attributes given from the school's reports (ex: term grades and student absences). The collection of this data was originally done by a portuguese professor who wanted to see the correlation between alcohol drinking and grades during 2005-2006. This dataset is now used on the UCI Machine Learning Archive. Its main purpose is to help students explore predictions using machine learning (ex: predicting students' final grades).
